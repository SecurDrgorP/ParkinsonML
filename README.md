# Parkinson's Disease Detection Using Machine Learning  

## **Overview**  
This repository contains a project aimed at detecting Parkinson's Disease through machine learning techniques applied to vocal characteristics. The models are built using supervised learning algorithms and feature selection/reduction methods to optimize prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.  

## **Key Features**  
- **Dataset**: Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Classification dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.  
- **Algorithms Used**: CART (Decision Tree), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and CatBoost.  
- **Feature Selection Methods**: Wrapper (Backward Elimination), Embedding (LassoCV), and Chi-Square.  
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA (Principal Component Analysis).  
- **Two Implementation Approaches**:  
  1. Using libraries (scikit-learn, CatBoost).  
  2. Custom-built implementations from scratch.  

## **Project Structure**  
- **/data**: Contains the dataset and preprocessed files.  
- **/notebooks**: Jupyter Notebooks for experimentation and visualization.  
- **/src**: Code for models, feature selection, and preprocessing.  
- **README.md**: Overview of the project.  

## **Usage**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/parkinsons-disease-detection.git
