# üß† Parkinson's Disease Detection Using Machine Learning

## üìã Overview

Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement, with early detection being crucial for effective management. This research project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to detect Parkinson's Disease using vocal biomarkers, demonstrating the potential of artificial intelligence in medical diagnostics.

## ‚ú® Project Features

### üîç Data Source
- **Dataset**: Parkinson's Disease Classification from the UCI Machine Learning Repository
- **Data Type**: Vocal feature measurements
- **Objective**: Binary classification (Parkinson's Disease: Yes/No)

### ü§ñ Machine Learning Algorithms
1. **CART (Classification and Regression Tree)**
   - Decision Tree-based classification
   - Interpretable model with clear decision boundaries

2. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
   - Kernel-based classification technique
   - Effective for non-linear decision boundaries
   - Multiple kernel options (linear, polynomial, radial basis function)

3. **CatBoost**
   - Advanced gradient boosting algorithm
   - Handles categorical features efficiently
   - Robust to overfitting

### üß¨ Feature Processing Techniques

1. **All Features Approach**
   - Utilizes entire feature set without modification
   - Baseline performance evaluation

2. **Advanced Feature Selection**
   Techniques used to identify most predictive features:
   - Wrapper Method: Backward Elimination
   - Embedding Method: LassoCV
   - Statistical Method: ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)

3. **Dimensionality Reduction**
   - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
   - Reduces feature space while preserving critical information
   - Mitigates curse of dimensionality
