# Parkinson's Disease Detection Using Machine Learning  

## **Overview**  
This project aims to detect Parkinson's Disease using vocal data by applying machine learning algorithms. Three models ‚Äî CART (Decision Tree), SVM (Support Vector Machines), and CatBoost ‚Äî are implemented across different feature processing methods. Both standard libraries and custom-built implementations are utilized to evaluate model performance.  

## **Project Features**  
- **Dataset**: Parkinson‚Äôs Disease Classification from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.  
- **Algorithms**:  
  - CART (Decision Tree)  
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
  - CatBoost  
- **Methods**:  
  1. **All Features** (`Toutes caract√©ristiques`): Using all features in the dataset.  
  2. **Feature Selection** (`La S√©lection des caract√©ristiques`): Combining features from:  
     - Wrapper Method (Backward Elimination)  
     - Embedding Method (LassoCV)  
     - ANOVA  
  3. **Dimensionality Reduction** (`R√©duction des donn√©es`): Principal Component Analysis (PCA).  
- **Implementation Approaches**:  
  - Using standard libraries like scikit-learn and CatBoost.  
  - Using custom-built implementations for each algorithm.  
 


## **Getting Started with Parkinson's Disease Detection Project**

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ installed
- Git installed on your system
- Basic understanding of Python and machine learning concepts

### üöÄ Project Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   # Clone the project repository
   git clone https://github.com/AbdulMoizAli/Parkinsons-Disease-Detection.git
   
   # Move into the project directory
   cd Parkinsons-Disease-Detection
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (Recommended):
   ```bash
   # Create a new virtual environment
   python -m venv env
   
   # Activate the virtual environment
   # On Windows
   env\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux
   source env/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # Install required Python libraries
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### üî¨ Exploring Model Implementations

This project includes three different machine learning model implementations for Parkinson's Disease detection:
